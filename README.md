## 🔭 Future Features  <a name="Formatting consistency"></a>

Formatting consistency verify that the code follows a consistent indentation style. This includes checking the number of spaces or tabs used for indentation and ensuring that it remains consistent throughout the codebase. Inconsistent indentation can make the code harder to read and understand.
